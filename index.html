      <div><em>"I have approximate knowledge of many things."</em></div>

      <p>Now that I'm an engineering manager, concrete technologies and tooling
        matter less than ever. By now, it is very likely that I have touched
        most of the aspects of a software engineer's life, at least on the
        conceptual level. And I seem to be a quick learner.
