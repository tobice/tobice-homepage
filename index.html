          I lead Web & Mobile frontend teams that are responsible for ticket
          booking and post-booking self-service. I mostly focus on improving
          code quality and general engineering processes. I still write a lot
          of documents and try to make others write documents.

          I have continued my work in the sensitive and nuanced area of privacy
          and consent. As a team co-lead, I influence all major decisions, drive
          standalone projects and mentor junior team members. I regularly
          collaborate with remote teams across the globe. I have also expanded
          my tech scope to Android and Web frontends.

      <div><em>"I have approximate knowledge of many things."</em></div>
      <p>Now that I'm an engineering manager, concrete technologies and tooling
        matter less than ever. By now, it is very likely that I have touched
        most of the aspects of a software engineer's life, at least on the
        conceptual level. And I seem to be a quick learner.

            platformer games. Interestingly, many of those approaches involve
            practical use of machine learning techniques that I encountered
