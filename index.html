    <h2>My developer profile</h2>
    <ul class="spaced">
        <li>
            I got a solid theoretical background from school. During my postgraduate studies I have
            been specializing (among other things) in <strong>Artificial Intelligence, Neural
            Networks, Machine learning</strong> and <strong>Data Mining</strong>.
        </li>

        <li>
		I use <strong>Java</strong> on a daily basis when working on <em>the super
		secret Google stuff&trade;</em>. Before joining Google, I used Java quite often
		for my school projects (e.g my <a href="#tuudl">bachelor’s thesis</a>,
            a <strong>Google App Engine</strong> application, or <a href="#tjfs">tjfs</a>).
        </li>


        <li>
            In my <a href="#appgen">master's thesis</a> I was dealing with Semantic Web related technologies, including
            <strong>RDF</strong>, <strong>SPARQL</strong> and <strong>Virtuoso</strong>.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Nette + PHP + MySQL</strong> is what I was using for a very long time at my daily job. With these
            technologies I can quickly develop robust, secure and extensible <a href="#factor">web applications</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
            I'm more than familiar with <strong>React.js, Redux</strong> and other
            <strong>JavaScript</strong> toys that have been getting popular lately.
            See my <a href="https://github.com/tobice">Github profile</a> for more info.
        </li>

        <li>
            I'm no stranger to <strong>functional programming</strong> either. Besides the aforementioned frontend
            technologies which in their nature take a lot from the functional world, I'm also experienced with
            <strong>Scala</strong> and <strong>Play Framework</strong>. My whole <a href="#appgen">master's thesis</a>
            is to a large extent functional.
        </li>

        <li>
            I have been using <strong>Linux</strong> as my main desktop OS since I was a
            teenager. I started with <strong>Gentoo</strong> and after few difficult years I
	    switched to <strong>OpenSuse</strong>. Currently I use <strong>Ubuntu</strong> 
	    for both work and fun. <em>Although I'm not a believer, I tried Mac once and it ended
	    up extremely badly (partially for ideological reasons)</em>.
        </li>
    </ul>
