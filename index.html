	<h2>My developer profile</h2>

	<ul class="spaced">
		<li>
			I got a solid theoretical background from school. During my postgraduate studies I have
		   	been specializing (among other things) in <strong>Artificial Intelligence, Neural
		  	Networks, Machine learning</strong> and <strong>Data Mining</strong>.
		</li>

		<li>
			<strong>Nette + PHP + MySQL</strong> is what I use at my current job. With these
			technologies I can quickly develop robust, secure and extensible
			<a href="#factor">web applications</a>.
		</li>

		<li>
			In my free time, I play with <strong>React.js, Flux</strong> and other
			<strong>JavaScript</strong> toys that have been getting popular lately.
			See my <a href="https://github.com/tobice">Github profile</a> for more info.
		</li>

		<li>
			I’m also pretty confident in <strong>Java</strong> as I use it quite often at
			school. Besides many smaller
			projects, my whole <a href="#tuudl">bachelor’s thesis</a>,
			a <strong>Google App Engine</strong> application,
			was written in Java. I also developed a small
			<a href="#bambule"><strong>Android</strong> application</a> for Alltoys.
		</li>

		<li>
			I have been using <strong>Linux</strong> as my main desktop OS since I was a
			teenager. I started with <strong>Gentoo</strong> and after few difficult years I
			switched to <strong>OpenSuse</strong>. <em>I’m not a believer, though. I got
			used to it and just never found a convincing reason to switch</em>.
		</li>

		<li>
			During my studies I came across many and many other languages, platforms, applications
			and technologies, such as: C#, C++, Python, functional/logical languages (Haskell,
			Prolog, Scala), Oracle databases, Matlab, R, Gephi, Windows Server etc.
		</li>

		<li>
			And yes, obviously <strong>I can speak English</strong>. I got
			<strong>107/120</strong> points on the standardized <strong>TOEFL</strong> test
			which approximately translates to the <strong>C1</strong> level. I’m used to reading
			technical documentation and discussing complex (not only work related) problems, both
			online and <i>offline</i>.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>The highlights of my work</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<h3>
				<a href="https://github.com/tobice/flux-lumines">Lumines
					<span class="year">(2015)</span></a>
			</h3>
			<div>
				JavaScript implementation of the legendary PSP game that you can try out on this
				page. It’s based on the bleeding-edge JS technologies like React.js, Flux and
				Immutable.js.
			</div>
		</li>

		<li>
			<h3>
				<a href="http://www.seewordpower.cz/">SEE | Matouš Roskovec – seewordpower.cz
					<span class="year">(2015)</span></a>
			</h3>
			<div>
				Coding and MODx Revolution backend for the personal web page of my cousin, a
				copywriter. The page is Bootstrap based, fully responsive and fairly small despite
				it is Retina ready, has a custom font and contains lots of graphical elements.
			</div>
		</li>

		<li>
			<h3>
				<a href="https://github.com/tobice/tellypal">TellyPal
					<span class="year">(2014)</span></a>
			</h3>
			<div>
				My first bigger JavaScript project, with Node.js backend and React.js/Flux frontend.
				TellyPal allows you to easily manage and download new episodes of your favorite TV
				shows. It works as a thin layer over
				<a href="http://www.thetvdb.com/">The TVDB</a>,
				<a href="http://torrentz.com/">Torrentz</a> and
				<a href="http://deluge-torrent.org/">Deluge BitTorrent Client</a>.
			</div>
		</li>

		<li>
			<h3 id="bambule">
				<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.alltoys.android.bambule">
					Bambule Android application <span class="year">(2014)</span>
				</a>
			</h3>
			<div>
				A simple Android application (written in Java) that I developed together with my
				schoolmate Katka Nevolová as a school project for Alltoys. It offers some basic
				functionality for the customers of the Bambule retail stores, such as locating the
				nearest store and accessing club member profile.
			</div>
		</li>

		<li>
			<h3 id="factor">
				<a href="https://factor.alltoys.cz/">Factor
					<span class="year">(2013-2014)</span></a>
			</h3>
			<div>
				Huge B2B e-shop that we developed in Alltoys using PHP/Nette. Factor was refined
				and polished to perfection with the specific needs of the wholesale environment
				in mind.
			</div>
		</li>

		<li>
			<h3 id="tuudl">Túúdl <span class="year">(2012-2013)</span></h3>
			<div>
				This was my bachelor’s thesis. It’s an application for high school e-learning,
				developed on Google App Engine platform, with Java/Spring MVC backend and
				HTML/JavaScript frontend. The point of the work was to face the challenges imposed
				by the cloud environment and a non-relational database.
			</div>
		</li>

		<li>
			<h3>
				<a href="http://www.semcr.cz/">SEM ČR website <span class="year">(2012)</span></a>
			</h3>
			<div>
				Complete website for a non-profit organisation: design, coding and MODx Evolution
				backend. It shows my humble Gimp painting skills. I also developed a custom module
				in PHP for managing the organisation agenda (members, fees…).
			</div>
		</li>

		<li>
			<h3>
				<a href="http://www.svoboda.info">Svoboda.info
					<span class="year">(2010-2014)</span></a>
			</h3>
			<div>
				A huge local news portal that I designed and coded from scratch. It’s built on top
				of MODx Evolution but it contains lots of custom modifications and modules (i. e.
				football results of local contests). As the website grew, it reached the limits of
				the framework which required invasive hacking of the CMS core. <em>As of July 2015,
				the website is maintained by an external company (with a proprietary CMS) but the
				design and functionality remains from 90% the same</em>.
